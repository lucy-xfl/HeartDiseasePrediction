•	Developed multiple ML models to identify if a patient was at risk for heart disease.

•	Preprocessed the unbalanced raw CDC dataset with over 300k observations and 18 features using Python.

•	Used Data Visualization packages such as Seaborn to describe the data and select target features.

•	Trained and compared a decision tree, random forest, KNN, and logistic regression models.

•	Utilized ROC curves to identify the most powerful model, achieving 80% accuracy on real-life data.
